# Multi-Modal-Approach-for-Osteosarcoma-Stage-Detection
This project implements a deep learning-based web application to classify osteosarcoma X-ray images into five distinct stages: Doubtful, Healthy Knee, Minimal, Moderate, and Severe. The system leverages multiple CNN architectures including a custom CNN, ResNet152V2, and VGG16, and is integrated into a Flask web app for real-time predictions.
